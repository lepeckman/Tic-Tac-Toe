# Tic-Tac-Toe

As the 3by3 grid did not fee like enough of my own creation, I needed to expan upon the challenge to make it my own. This attempt at a 5by5 game of Tic-Tac-Toe still needs work. The game board includes numbers below each cell, so players may quickly choose their spot on the board. 

Is it the IPython display that's causing trouble? Or the established parameters of this particular Jupyter Notebook? 

More investigation required.
